Subject: "🦍 Why Uganda Beats Rwanda for Gorilla Trekking (Insider Secret)"

Hi [First Name],

Yesterday, Sarah from Colorado asked me: "James, should I choose Uganda or Rwanda for gorilla trekking?"

Great question! Here's my insider perspective after 12 years in safari business:

🇺🇬 UGANDA WINS FOR:
• Price: $650 vs Rwanda's $1,200+ 
• Authentic experience: Less touristy, more wilderness
• Multiple gorilla families: 19 habituated families vs Rwanda's 12
• Longer encounters: Often get extra time with gorillas
• Bonus wildlife: Chimpanzees, Big Five, Murchison Falls

🇷🇼 RWANDA WINS FOR:
• Convenience: Shorter drive from airport
• Luxury lodges: More high-end accommodation options  
• Easier trek: Generally shorter hikes

THE VERDICT: 89% of our clients choose Uganda and here's why...
